Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Baban Bandgar
Algorithm Analysis
Algorithm analysis is the process of evaluating the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of its use of computational resources, primarily time and memory. The goal of algorithm analysis is to determine how well an algorithm will perform in practice and how it scales as the input size increases
